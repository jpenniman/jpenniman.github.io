OMG! I am so excited to have found this tool!

`mkcert`

On GitHub at [https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

I use Ubuntu, so to install on my system...

``` bash
sudo apt install mkcert libnss3-tools
```

Then, we need to install the certificate authority (CA) used to sign our certificates...

``` bash
mkcert -install
```

Now we are ready to create certs!

``` bash
mkcert app.localhost
```

## .localhost TLD

[RFC 6761](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6761)

The `.localhost` top level domain (TLD) is supported by Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The local resolver will automatically
resolve any host or subdomain of `.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`--the local loopback address without the need to add entries
to your `/etc/hosts` file.

Try it for yourself, ping an arbitrary host using that domain. You will see it resolve and successfully ping 127.0.0.1...

``` bash
ping app.localhost
```

Putting the two together, you can create certificates for specific apps you are building and get more production-like
behavior.
